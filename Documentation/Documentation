Backend.
For backend has been used DRF(DjangoRestFramework) with Python 3.12.8

## üåê Languages Supported by Backend

Supported languages:

- `pt` ‚Äî Portuguese
- `en` ‚Äî English
- `ru` ‚Äî Russian

To test translations, you can simply add `{{lng}}/` after the `BASE_URL`.
Example: http://127.0.0.1:8000/{{lng}}/

Here, `lng` is a dynamic variable responsible for switching the language.

For static language switching, just use the language code directly in the URL.
Example:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/pt/
