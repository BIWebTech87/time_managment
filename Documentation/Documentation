Backend.
For backend has been used DRF(DjangoRestFramework) with Python 3.12.8

Atention all URL's is used like http://127.0.0.1:8000/


## üåê Languages Supported by Backend

Supported languages:

- `pt` ‚Äî Portuguese
- `en` ‚Äî English
- `ru` ‚Äî Russian

To test translations, you can simply add `{{lng}}/` after the `BASE_URL`.
Example: http://127.0.0.1:8000/{{lng}}/

Here, `lng` is a dynamic variable responsible for switching the language.

For static language switching, just use the language code directly in the URL.
Example:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/pt/

    SIGN UP ‚Äî DRF requires a POST request in JSON format to the following URL:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/{{lng}}/api/v1/employees/

    {
        "email": "test@email.com",
        "first_name": "exampleFN",
        "last_name": "exampleLN",
        "password": "example"
    }

    The email field must be unique, which means two employees cannot share the same email address.

        "last_name": "editedExampleLN",
        "password": "editedExample"

    {
        "email": "test@email.com",
